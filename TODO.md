= Bugs
* First been is very short
* go -> rest doesnt work very well

= Outstanding
* Starting the timer should show the configured time
* Power button should stop existing modes fully

* Pressing play/pause at various times, including alerting
* FF should skip the rest

* Rest countdown doesn't use configured time

* millis will wrap at 50 days
