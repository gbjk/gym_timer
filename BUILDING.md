## Options

* Use a cheap cloned nano board, but be careful about the FTDI chip
* mininthebox used to have some 4" 7 segments digits for £5.87 each, but they got slapped with customs Making the total cost £37, and are also no longer available.
* Reclaim a power supply from anything else, so long as it's regulated 12v and >2A.
* Salvage a remote control, and scan for the codes
